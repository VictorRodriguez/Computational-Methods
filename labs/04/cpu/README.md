# Deliverable 1: Machine state and CPU simulator

An example of the expected code is in src/ directory

* cpu.py: The core brain of your robot that: 
	* Read the instructions.asm
	* Execute each instruction
	* Draw the state of the field (2-D matrix)

Deliver as PDF generated from this README.md file the report that includes

* Description of the problem
* Link to the source code of your Github project
* Diagram of the automata ( NDF or DFA ) that define the logic of your CPU ( use graphviz )
